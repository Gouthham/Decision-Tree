# Decision-Tree Classifier for Predicting Play Tennis Outcomes


This project demonstrates a Decision Tree classifier applied to the "Play Tennis" dataset.The dataset, which is offered in CSV format, includes features like weather and other aspects that affect the decision of playing tennis or not on a certain day.

The Decision Tree model is trained to predict the result (Play Tennis: Yes/No) based on input features like outlook, temperature, humidity, and wind using Python and machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. Preprocessing the data, training the model, and visualising the Decision Tree are all part of the project to show how decisions are made. This tool provides a clear understanding of how Decision Trees can be applied to basic classification problems.
